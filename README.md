# Python introduction notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for courses I have taught introducing Python.

They presume no prior programming knowledge, and are designed to be taught in a two or three hour module.

The lessons are project based, with the goal being to write a specific function (or group of functions) by the end of the session that will be useful for researchers. Therefore, the introduction to programming concepts is limited to what is necessary (or useful) to create the function.
