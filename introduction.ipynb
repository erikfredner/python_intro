    "This notebook aims to get you familiar with essential aspects of the [Python](https://www.python.org) language. Anaconda is a *distribution* of Python widely used in data science that comes with many useful packages preinstalled. Jupyter Lab, which you're using right now, is one such package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is great for a lot of different tasks in computational literary studies. Combined with the `pandas` package for tabular data, it can be used to do just about anything that you would use the R language for. But, especially for people who haven't written code before, Python is generally much easier than R.\n",

    "# Learn by doing: upgrading text search\n",
    "One of the best ways to learn to program is by trying to figure out particular problems. So, today we're going to create an upgraded version of the `cmd/ctrl + F` search to find sets of words within user-defined proximity of one another. That is, we'll be able to find not only our target word (e.g. \"whale\") but also where it co-occurs with another target word (e.g. \"Ahab\").\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one type of keywords in context analysis, where a \"contex\" is ususally defined as a fixed number of words or sentences surrounding our target word(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we learn along the way\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the above, we'll learn many of the key ideas in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- strings\n",
    "- integers\n",
    "- variables\n",
    "- reading files\n",
    "- lists\n",
    "- indexing\n",
    "- Booleans\n",
    "- `for` loops\n",
    "- functions\n",
    "\n",
    "I briefly introduce each of these, and demonstrate how they can be applied in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "# First steps: `hello world`\n",
    "Of course, we have to start somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the first program you write prints the phrase `hello world` to standard output. In Python, we write that this way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('hello world')\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Jupyter Lab, we execute Python commands in code cells, like the one below. The output of each cell is printed immediately below."
